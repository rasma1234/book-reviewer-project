## Coding Exercise: Building a Book Review API
*Goal:* Your objective is to build a Django API for storing and fetching book reviews.
### Instructions:
1. *Initial Set Up:*
    - Create a new directory named book_reviews.
    - Set up a virtual environment and activate it.
    - Install Django in this environment.
    - Create a new Django project named review_project.
    - Start a new app named reviews.
    - Migrate the project to set up the initial database.
    - Add the reviews app to the INSTALLED_APPS setting.
2. *Git Setup:*
   - Initialize a new git repository within the book_reviews directory.
   - Create a .gitignore file and add entries for:
     1. .venv
     2. *.pyc
     3. db.sqlite3 (or your chosen database file)
   - Commit your changes with the message "initial commit".
3. *Models:*
   - Define a Book model with fields:
     - title: CharField (max length of 255 characters)
     - author: CharField (max length of 255 characters)
   - Define a Review model with fields:
     - book: ForeignKey relating to the Book model
     - review_text: TextField
     - rating: IntegerField (with a range between 1 to 5)
   - Migrate your models.
4. *Admin Interface:*
   - Register both Book and Review models with the Django admin site.
   - Create a superuser account to manage your data via the admin interface.
5. *Tests:*
   - Write tests for both Book and Review models to ensure that their data is stored correctly and that their string representations (__str__ method) are correct.
6. *Serializers:*
   - Create a serializer for Book model displaying id, title, and author.
   - Create a serializer for Review model displaying id, book, review_text, and rating.
7. *URLs:*
   - Ensure all API endpoints have a consistent path such as api/.
   - Define URLs for:
     1. List and detail views of books (e.g., api/books/ and api/books/<id>/)
     2. List and detail views of reviews (e.g., api/reviews/ and api/reviews/<id>/)
8. *Views:*
   - Use Django REST Framework's generic views to create:
     - List and detail views for Book.
     - List and detail views for Review.
9. *Browsable API:*
   - Test your API using Django REST Framework’s browsable interface. Add a few books and reviews through the interface and ensure that they are retrievable through the API endpoints.
